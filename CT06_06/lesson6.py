## Recap 1: Class Average Calculator

# You have been tasked to create a programme that calculates the
# average marks of a class.

# Your programme will have to ask the
# user for the total number of students, followed by the marks of
# each student one at a time.

# Use only variables, math operators that you have learnt, as
# well as a 'for' loop.

# Student = int(input("How many students do you have?"))
# sum = 0
# for i in range(1, Student + 1):
#     sum = sum + int(input("What is student #" + str(i) + "s score?"))

# print("My sum is : " + str(sum))
# print("My average is : " + str(sum / Student))

## Task 1: Syntax Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 1a**:
# for i in range(3):
#     print("Hello, World!")

# **Task 1b**:
# for i in range(5):
#     print(i)

# **Task 1c**:
# print("Hello, World!")

# **Task 1d**:
# Hi = 5

# **Task 1e**:
# print("Hello, World!")

## Task 2: Name Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 2a**:
# print("age")

# **Task 2b**:
# name = "Alice"
# print(name)

# **Task 2c**:
# x = 5
# print(x)


# **Task 2d**:
# print("Hello, World!")

## Task 3: Type Errors
# Fix the errors in the following:

# **Task 3a**:
age = "25"
print(age + 1)

# **Task 3b**:
number = 10
print(number - 5)

# **Task 3c**:
print("Repeat" + "3")

# **Task 3d**:
year = 2023
print("The year is " + str(year))

# **Task 3e**:
x = 10
y = x / 2

# **Task 3f**:
end = 5
for i in range(end):
    print(i)

# print(answer)
## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:

# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79

# (60+50+98+79)/4 = average
# print (average)

# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize total_score to 0 (total_score = 0)
# 3. Add Adam's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 60)
# 4. Add Brandon's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 58)
# 5. Add Charlie's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 98)
# 6. Add Daniel's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 79)
# 7. Calculate the number of students (num_students = 4)
# 8. Calculate the average score (average_score = total_score / num_students)
# 9. Print the average_score (print(average_score))
# 10. End
# 1a
# age = input("What is your age")
# print(age)
#1b
# x = 10
# x = 20
# print(x)

## Task 2: Simple addition calculator
# **Task 2a**:
# Create 2 variables holding 2 different numbers:
# Print out the sum ("+") of the 2 numbers
y = 1066
z = 1438
# print(y + z)
# print(y - z)
# print(y * z)
# print(y / z)


## Task 3: Mathematics with variables
# For each of the following questions, create variables to hold
# the values given before finally using print(ans) to print the
# answer:

# **Task 3a**:
# Create 2 variables 'a' and 'b', assign any number to
# them and print their sum.

# **Task 3b**:
# Subtract 10 from 50, then multiply the result by 3.

# **Task 3c**:
# Divide 100 by 4 and print the result.

# **Task 3d**:
# Calculate and print the result of (3 + 4) * 5 - (10 / 2).

# **Task 3e**:
# Calculate and print the result of 3 / 2.

y = 674
z = 342
print(y + z)
print(50 - 10 * 3)

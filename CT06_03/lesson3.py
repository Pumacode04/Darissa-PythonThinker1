## Recap 1: Pseudo Code Practice
# Write a pseudocode that calculates the average score of the 4
# students:

# Adam: 60
# Brandon: 58
# Charlie: 98
# Daniel: 79

# (60+50+98+79)/4 = average
# print (average)

# 1. Start
# 2. Initialize total_score to 0 (total_score = 0)
# 3. Add Adam's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 60)
# 4. Add Brandon's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 58)
# 5. Add Charlie's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 98)
# 6. Add Daniel's score to total_score (total_score = total_score + 79)
# 7. Calculate the number of students (num_students = 4)
# 8. Calculate the average score (average_score = total_score / num_students)
# 9. Print the average_score (print(average_score))
# 10. End
# 1a
# age = input("What is your age")
# print(age)
#1b
# x = 10
# x = 20
# print(x)
print(36)
